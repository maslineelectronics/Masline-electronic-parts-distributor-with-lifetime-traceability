## Electronic Parts Distributor with Lifetime Traceability

Lifetime traceability refers to the continuous documentation of a component’s path from its original manufacturer through distribution, testing, storage, and final delivery. This ensures that every part is accounted for, minimizing the risks of counterfeit infiltration, quality issues, and non-compliance.

### Key Elements of Lifetime Traceability
- **Origin Tracking:** Manufacturer name, lot code, and production batch records.  
- **Process Documentation:** Inspection, testing, and storage conditions recorded.  
- **Supply Chain Transparency:** Supplier details and transaction records maintained.  
- **Permanent Recordkeeping:** Data archived for future audits or quality reviews.  
- **Compliance Evidence:** Certifications retained to prove adherence to standards.  

With lifetime traceability, customers gain access to the complete history of each component used in their assemblies or products.
